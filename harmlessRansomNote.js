// You have been given two strings. You have to find out whether you can make up the first string with the words present in the second string.
/* Example
Note1: 'this is a secret note for you from a secret admirer'
Note2: 'this is a note for you from a secret admirer'
Magazine: 'puerto rico is a great place you must hike far from town to find a secret waterfall that i am an admirer of but note that it is not as hard as it seems this is my advice for you

* Purpose is do we have enough words to create our note, If yes then algorithm returns true else it returns false.
* Note1 would return false because the word secret is used once in the Magazine but appears twice in Note1.
* Note2 Would retun true because all words needed could be found in the magazine.
